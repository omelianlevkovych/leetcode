Done with help:  
```
922 - very smart two pointers (i = 0, j = 1, move two steps and check condition)
1089
26 - two pointers (very wise approach tbh)
```
Done by myself but need attention:  
```
1748 - solved with sorting O(n*logn) while using hashmap its O(n)
1380 - from solution, zip(), *matrix, set intersection operator &
1769 - there are smarter solution with O(n)
88 - I did it@! Well it definitely took too much time than required :)
```

Didin't get the solution yet:
```
496
```


Notes:
```
numer(i) - where number is number of the question, and i is the amount of times I did it
Two pointers is a great technique. Usually I find it useful when doing in-place manipulation on arrays/strings.
```
